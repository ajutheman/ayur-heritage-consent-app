I agree to assume those risks and possible failures associated with, but not limited to, the following:"),
InputWidget.ParagraphWidget("(even though the utmost care and diligence is exercised in preparation for, and fabrication of, prosthetic appliances, there is the possibility of failure with patients not adapting to them):"),

InputWidget.ParagraphWidget("a)   natural teeth to which partial dentures are anchored (called abutment teeth) may become tender, sore,    and/or mobile;"),

InputWidget.ParagraphWidget("a) chewing on foods or objects which are excessively hard;"),
InputWidget.ParagraphWidget("b) gum tissue shrinkage which causes excessive pressures to be exerted unevenly on the dentures;"),
InputWidget.ParagraphWidget("c) cracks which may be unnoticeable and which occurred previously from causes such as those mentioned in (1) and (2); or the dentures having being dropped or damaged previously. The above may also cause extensive denture tooth wear or chipping."),
InputWidget.ParagraphWidget("4. Loose Dentures: Full dentures normally become looser when there are changes in the supporting gum tissues. Dentures themselves do not change unless subjected to extreme heat or dryness. When dentures become “loose”, relining the dentures may be necessary. Normally, it is necessary to charge for relining dentures. Partial dentures become loose for the listed reasons in addition to clasps or other attachments loosening. Sometimes dentures feel loose for other reasons."),
InputWidget.ParagraphWidget("5. Allergies to dental materials: Very infrequently, the oral tissues may exhibit allergic symptoms to the materials used in the construction of either partial dentures or full dentures, over which we have no control."),
InputWidget.ParagraphWidget("6. Failure of supporting teeth and/or soft tissue: Natural teeth supporting partials may fail due to decay; excessive trauma; gum tissue or bony tissue problems. This may necessitate extraction. The supporting soft tissues may fail due to many problems including poor dental or general health."),
